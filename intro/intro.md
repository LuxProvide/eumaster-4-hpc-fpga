## FPGA cards

FPGA Development Boards and HPC (High-Performance Computing) FPGA Cards serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

1. **FPGA Development Boards** are primarily designed for learning, prototyping, and small-scale projects. They typically feature user-friendly interfaces, a variety of I/O options, and often include additional components like sensors, buttons, and displays. These boards are intended for engineers, students, and hobbyists to develop and test FPGA-based designs.

2. **HPC FPGA Cards**, on the other hand, are specialized for High-Performance Computing tasks. These cards are optimized for integration into data centers and High-Performance Computing environments. They focus on maximizing computational power, energy efficiency, and data throughput. HPC FPGA cards are usually designed to be mounted in servers or workstations, and they often support advanced features like high-speed memory interfaces and network connectivity.

## HDL vs HLS

* <u>**Hardware Description Language**</u> require a more detailed specification of the hardware, providing a gate-level or Register Transfer Level (RTL) description. They require knowledge of the specific hardware constructs, like registers, flip-flops, etc. 

    - <u>Productivity</u>: typically takes more time as developers have to manually describe the low-level hardware details. This can result in more control and optimization but is generally more time-consuming.
    - <u>Flexibility & Optimization</u>: allow developers to describe hardware at a more granular level, there is usually greater opportunity for manual optimization of the design.
    - <u>Learning curve</u> require a deeper understanding of hardware concepts. Thus, there's a steeper learning curve, but it can provide more expertise in hardware design.
    - <u>Use cases</u> is used for more traditional hardware design, where control over implementation details and optimizations is critical.

* <u>**High-Level Synthesis**</u> allows designers to describe hardware using high-level programming languages like C, C++, or SystemC. This means that HLS works at a higher level of abstraction, where developers can describe algorithms or logic without specifying the exact hardware details speeding up design. C/C++ code/kernels are translated to HDL using an offline compiler.  

    - <u>Productivity</u>: offer faster development time since engineers can write code using familiar programming paradigms. Automated synthesis tools then translate the high-level code into RTL, allowing quicker prototyping.
    - <u>Flexibility & Optimization</u>:  can accelerate development but it often provides less control over the final hardware implementation. This might result in less efficient utilization of FPGA resources or higher latency compared to hand-crafted RTL code.
    - <u>Learning curve</u> has a lower learning curve for software engineers or those familiar with C/C++. This makes it more accessible to developers who might not have a hardware background.
    - <u>Use cases</u> is often preferred for algorithm development, data flow designs, and when a software prototype exists that needs to be converted into hardware.


## HLS and Kernel-based programming: from OpenCL to SYCL

### <u>OpenCL: a Low-level API</u>

![](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/apis/2020-opencl-api-overview-2_3.jpg)

* [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) is widely used throughout the industry

* Kernel-based programming 

* Many silicon vendors ship OpenCL with their processors, including GPUs, DSPs and FPGAs

![](./images/fpga_opencl.png)

### <u>SYCL: a High-level C++ abstraction</u>

![](./images/sycl_desc.png){ align=right width=350 }

* Full coverage for all OpenCL features

* Interop to enable existing OpenCL code with SYCL

* Single-source compilation

* Automatic scheduling of data movement

## Architecture of an FPGA

* The differences between Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for CPUs and Spatial Architecture for FPGAs lie in how they process instructions and handle computation:

- **ISA for CPUs**: Sequential, control-flow-oriented, with a fixed architecture using a predefined set of instructions. Suitable for general-purpose tasks.

- **Spatial Architecture for FPGAs**: Parallel, data-flow-oriented, with a customizable architecture that can be tailored for specific high-performance tasks. Suitable for specialized, parallelizable workloads.

!!! note "Difference between **Instruction Set** architecture and **Spatial** architecture"
    === "Instruction Set Architecture"
        * Made for general-purpose computation: hardware is constantly reused 
        * Workflow constrained by a set of pre-defined units (Control Units, ALUs, registers)
        * Data/Register size are fixed
        * Different instruction executed in each clock cycle : **temporal** execution  
        ![](./images/isa.png)

    === "Spatial Architecture"
        * Keep only what it needs -- the hardware can be reconfigured
        * Specialize everything by unrolling the hardware: **spatial** execution
        * Each operation uses a different hardware region
        * The design can take more space than the FPGA offers 

        <figure markdown>
        ![](./images/spatial_arch.png){ width=70% }
        </figure>

* The most obvious source of **parallelism** for FPGA is **pipelining** by inserting registers to store each operation output and keep all hardware unit busy. 

* Pipelining parallelism has therefore many stages. 

* If you don't have enough work to fill the pipeline, then the efficiency is very low.

* The authors of the [DPC++ book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5574-2) have illustrated it perfectly in Chapter 17.

!!! warning "Vectorization"
    Vectorization is also possible but is not the main source of parallelism but help designing efficient pipeline. Since hardware can be reconfigured at will. The offline compiler can design N-bits Adders, multipliers which simplify greatly vectorization. In fact, the offline compiler vectorizes your design automatically if possible.

## FPGA parallelism: pipelining

!!! abstract "Pipelining (see FPGA Optimization Guide for IntelÂ® oneAPI Toolkits)"
    * Pipelining is a design technique used in synchronous digital circuits to increase maximum frequency (fMAX).
    * This technique involves adding registers to the critical path, reducing the amount of logic between each register.
    * Reducing logic between registers decreases execution time, enabling an increase in fMAX.
    * **The critical path** is the path between two consecutive registers that has the highest latency, meaning itâ€™s where operations take the longest to complete.
    * Pipelining is especially effective for processing a stream of data.
    * In a pipelined circuit, different stages can process different data inputs within the same clock cycle.
    * This design improves data processing throughput.

    ![](./images/pipeline.png)

!!! abstract "Maximum Frequency (fMAX)"
    * The **fMAX** of a digital circuit is its highest possible clock frequency, determining the maximum rate for updating register outputs. 
    * This speed is constrained by the physical propagation delay of the signal across the combinational logic between consecutive register stages.
    * The delay is affected by the complexity of the combinational logic in the path, and the path with the greatest number of logic elements and highest delay sets the speed limit for the entire circuit, often known as the **critical path**. 
    * The fMAX is the reciprocal of this critical path delay, and having a high fMAX is desirable as it leads to better performance when there are no other restrictions.
    ![](./images/fmax.png)


!!! abstract "Occupancy"
    * The **occupancy** of a datapath at a specific moment signifies the fraction of the datapath filled with valid data.
    * When looking at a circuit's execution of a program, the occupancy is the mean value from the beginning to the end of the program's run.
    * Parts of the datapath that are unoccupied are commonly called bubbles, akin to a CPU's no-operation (no-ops) instructions, which don't influence the final output.
    * Minimizing these bubbles leads to greater occupancy. If there are no other hindrances, optimizing the occupancy of the datapath will boost throughput.
